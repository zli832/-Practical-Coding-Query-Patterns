# SQL Fundamental Cases Practices

This repository contains my practice solutions for the SQL problem set, focusing on fundamental and commonly tested SQL queries used in data analysis roles.

The goal of this repository is to strengthen my ability to:
- Write clean and readable SQL queries
- Translate business questions into SQL logic

The cases mainly cover the following SQL topics:

- Basic filtering and selection (`SELECT`, `WHERE`)
